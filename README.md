# GotYourBackApp
This App creates automated backups of a specific file whenever it changes, while keeping multiple last versions.
 
 ## Installation Instructions
There isn't a way to install it yet.

 ## Roadmap:
These are the things I want to do:
 * Keep a list of the files/folders to be watched.
 * Remember last backup time for each file.
 * Check periodically for changes in file, by comparing current file date to last backup date.
